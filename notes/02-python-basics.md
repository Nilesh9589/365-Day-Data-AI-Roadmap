 (## Day 2: Data Types and Input).
 constants; Fixed values such as numbers, letters, and strings, are called
"constants" because their value does not change
Numeric constants are as you expect
String constants use single quotes (*)
or double quotes (")

Variable; their value are choosed by programmer, temporary store value can be changed later in the statment.
example; a=1;

Operator Precedence Rules
Highest precedence rule to lowest precedence rule:
• Parentheses are always respected
• Exponentiation (raise to a power)
• Multiplication, Division, and Remainder
• Addition and Subtraction
• Left to right

Types of data
• In Python variables, literals, and
constants have a "type"
• Python knows the difference between
an integer number and a string
• For example "+" means "addition" if
something is a number and
"concatenate" if something is a string

type() is indeed a built-in function in Python. It’s used to determine the data type of a value or variable.

In Python, a function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Think of it like a mini-program within your program—it helps you organize your logic, avoid repetition, and make your code cleaner and easier to understand.


 input() function always gives you a string (text)
