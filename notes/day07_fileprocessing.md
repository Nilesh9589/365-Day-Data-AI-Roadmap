The Two Natures of a File Object
A file object in Python is versatile. How it behaves depends on the command you give it.

1. The "List of Lines" Nature (Line by Line)
When you write for line in file:, you are telling Python to treat the file object like a sequence of lines. Python's for loop knows how to handle this specific instruction. It reads just enough of the file to get one complete line (ending with a \n newline character), puts that line into your line variable, and waits for your code to process it before fetching the next one. This is very memory-efficient for large files.

Analogy: This is like reading a book page by page. You read the first page, process what's on it, and only then do you turn to the next page.

Python

# This treats the file as a sequence of lines
with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line) # Processes one line at a time
2. The "Single Blob of Text" Nature (All at Once)
You only get the "whole string as one" behavior when you specifically command it to do so using the .read() method. This method tells Python to read from the current position all the way to the end of the file and dump everything into a single string variable.

Analogy: This is like putting a book on a photocopier and getting one giant image of all the pages stitched together.

Python

# This treats the file as one single string
with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read() 
    print(content) # Processes the entire content at once
