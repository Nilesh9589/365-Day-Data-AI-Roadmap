# Day 1: Python Fundamentals
Cetral Processing Unit; in hardware the closest brain computer have is cpu. Instuction goes into this cpu.

Main Memory; the memory feeds the instuction to cpu because cpu can not store them ,so for storing and communicating of our instruction to cpu we need main memory.Memory vanishes after power off.
it temporarily holds:
ðŸ”„ Programs that are currently running (like your browser, Python interpreter, or a game)

 Secondary Memory;This have permanent storage.is where all your software and files are actually saved long-term.

#  Python Fundamentals

Reserved words ; this are the words python don't want us to use as variable name and inteifiers ,function names.

Quick examples:

if, else, elif â†’ used for conditional logic

def â†’ used to define functions

for, while â†’ used for loops

True, False, None â†’ special constants

import â†’ used to bring in external modules
