 #This problem will test  your understanding of loops, conditionals (if%e==0lif%e==0lse), and basic data type manipulatio n.
 #The Task :
 #Write a single Python function called number_game that takes one integer, n, as an argumen t. The function should loop through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) and print a specific output based  on the following rules, in this exact order of priority:
 # If the number contai ns the digit '7' (e.g., 7, 17 , 27), it must print "Lucky". This rule  overrides al l others .
 # If the number is a m ultiple of both 3 and 5, it must print "FizzBuzz" .
 #If the number is a multiple of only 3, it must print "Fizz".
 # If the number is a multiple of only 5, it must print "Buzz" .
 #Otherwise, it should just print the number itself .
try:
   n=int(input("< enter your number"))
   def number_game(n):
    
#If the number contains the digit '7' (e.g., 7, 17, 27), it must print "Lucky". This rule overrides all others.

The Task: The Prime Number Finder
Write a single Python function called analyze_primes that takes one integer, n, as an argument. The function must:
Find and print every prime number between 2 and n (inclusive).
After finding all the primes, it should print the total count of how many prime numbers were found.
## What is a Prime Number?
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 5 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 5. 
The number 6 is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6."""
