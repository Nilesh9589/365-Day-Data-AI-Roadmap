## My First Big Question (Indian Example) ðŸ¤”

### **Question:** In a `while` loop, why does Python wait to run the code *after* the loop instead of right away?

**Answer in Simple Terms:**

Think of it like making rotis for dinner.

The rule is: "**Jab tak atta hai**" (As long as there is dough), repeat these steps:
- **Step 1 (indented):** Take a small piece of dough (`loi`).
- **Step 2 (indented):** Roll it out (`belo`).
- **Step 3 (indented):** Cook it on the tawa (`seko`).

These **indented steps** are the work you have to repeat for every single roti.

Then, the final task *after* all the rotis are made is:
- **Clean the kitchen platform.** (This is **not** indented).

You only clean the platform **after** the dough is completely finished and the last roti is made. Python works the exact same way. The indented part is the repeated work, and the line after it is the final step that only happens once the loop's condition is no longer true.
